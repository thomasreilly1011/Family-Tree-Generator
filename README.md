# Family Tree Generator
A web app intended for modelling family tree structures and displaying them in a simple inuitive UI. This is a personal project for me to expose myself to new technologies including React.js and Node.js. Any suggestions or constructive criticism is appreciated via Github or thomas.edreilly@gmail.com.
